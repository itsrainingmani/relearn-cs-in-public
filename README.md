Re-learning CS fundamentals in Public

## I already have a Computer Science degree. Why bother re-learning the fundamentals?

Fundamentals are named so for a reason. They are the foundational aspects of any long-lasting domain specific knowledge. Mastering the fundamentals is crucial to developing critical understanding of higher-level and complex topics.
Over the last few years, I've felt my knowledge of CS slowly ebb away since I spend most of time doing relatively un-complicated web development. But I believe that if I want to level up in my professional career and seek better opportunities, I need to focus on re-acquiring the knowledge that I lack now.

I believe that in this process, I will not only solidify the fundamentals but also potentially gain better insights into what I am doing now.
